# recurclam
A simple script for parallel ClamAV scanning.

## running
First check if you have a TypeScript-compatible Node interpreter. I recommend using [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

Then open `recurclam.ts` in a text editor and adjust the configuration to your needs.

After that, simply run the script with your interpreter. For example: `bun run recurclam.ts`

## disclaimer

You're using the recurclam at your own risk. I'm not responsible for any possible damages done by the script.
